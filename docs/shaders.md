# Shader Resources

## Overview

Since shader coding is at the core of Conjurer and it is an incredibly complex topic, let's use this page to list resources that are helpful in developing shaders.

## Learning shaders from scratch

1. [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) - Hands down the best resource out there for learning shaders from scratch. Really, give it a shot!
1. [An Introduction to Shader Art Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4s1h2YETNY) - Really high quality production video about designing shader art.

## Shadertoy

Check out this website, browse around, and get inspired! People share their shader code and you can see it run right in your browser.
